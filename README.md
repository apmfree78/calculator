## Scientific Calculator - Built with React and Bootstrap

Does all standard calculations with floating point numbers (returns result
rounded to 2 decimal points). Also does exponents (i.e. 2^2 = 4), plus sin and
cos.

## Uses Advanced Regex plus Recursion to Parse Nested Brakets

Goes way further than your standard calculator by allowing brakets. Not just
brakets but you can even do nested brakets. Try 1+(1+(1+(1+1))) and see what you
get . :)
